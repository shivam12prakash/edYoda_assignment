// Commands Applied
COMMAND --> kubectl apply -f

// Deleting Vote Pod

COMMAND --> kubectl delete pod vote-7d884dd585-6rmzg

---> New Pod is created => pod/vote-7d884dd585-f6hst  

OBSERVATION AFTER DELETION:

-- No specific changes observed or rendered on the Frontend
-- A new Pod is created as pod/vote-7d884dd585-f6hst


// Deleting Worker Pod

COMMAND --> kubectl delete pod worker-6fc5d5b668-zhxhj

---> New Pod is created => pod/worker-6fc5d5b668-9k7nb

OBSERVATION AFTER DELETION:

-- No specific changes observed or rendered on the Frontend
-- A new Pod is created as pod/worker-6fc5d5b668-9k7nb

// Deleting DB Pod

COMMAND --> kubectl delete pod db-58cc845644-w9mtn

---> New Pod is created => db-58cc845644-w9mtn 

OBSERVATION AFTER DELETION:

-- The data is no longer available but there is no impact on the Vote page/screen.
-- A new Pod is created as db-58cc845644-w9mtn 
-- The Worker and Result pod had a restart and "RESTARTS 1" for both of them.


// Question:
What happens after db pod deletion?

-- The Worker and Result pod restarted after the db pod deletion, Worker pod is collecting the data and pusing to the Db.
-- Result pod is leveraging the db and providing the vote related data from the db so both had the restart.
-- after few seconds all are back to running states and new votes are taken into consideration.
